# Movie Tracker App

This repository allows anyone to download a movie tracker web application that allows users to post their own movie reviews as well as see the reviews of other users. A user can also edit and delete their own reviews.


## Installation

This web app will be locally hosted on your machine. First, clone this repository. Then, run `bundle install` to ensure all gems are present. Once this is complete, run `shotgun`, go to the "/" route, sign up and you will be able to start adding your own movie reviews!

## Contributor's Guide

Feel free to help expand the functionality of this application. Eventually, I would like to add the API that I used for my movie_cli app to have extra information associated with a given movie.
