# Movie Tracker App

This repository allows anyone to download a movie tracker web application that allows users to post their own movie reviews as well as see the reviews of other users. A user can also edit and delete their own reviews.


## Installation

This is a work in progress. Clone this respository to your own machine. Run 'bundle install' and run all of your migrations. Once this is complete, run shotgun and go to the "/" route to sign up and start adding your own movie reviews!
```
    $ ruby bin/movie_cli
```
## Contributor's Guide

Feel free to help expand the functionality of this application. Eventually, I would like to add the API from my movie_cli app to have extra information associated with a given movie.
